# Cafe Operations Simulation
## Overview
This project aimed to optimize the operations of Chaiiology Café, a local eatery in Cardiff that offers hot food, desserts, and drinks for dine-in and takeaway. By simulating different operational scenarios using Simul8, we focused on reducing customer wait times to enhance customer satisfaction and improve business profitability.
## Features
* **Simulation of Standard Café Operations:** Replicates a typical busy Saturday using real-time data.
* **Analysis of Waiting Times:** Identifies and explores the root causes of extended customer wait times.
* **Operational Optimization:** Tests various strategies to improve efficiency, such as adjusting staff levels and reconfiguring table layouts.
## Data
The simulation utilised data which included:
* Customer inter-arrival times.
* Service methods (Dine-in/Takeaway).
* Order types (Food/Desserts & Drinks).
* Order quantities and preparation times.
* Staff allocation and table utilisation.
## Methodology
The approach combined observational data collection with advanced simulation techniques:
* **Data Collection:** Collected data throughout the café's operational hours.
* **Model Building:** Used Simul8 to construct the simulation model, integrating real-time data inputs and outputs for a detailed operational analysis.
* **Scenario Testing:** Conducted experiments within the simulation to find the most effective changes for reducing wait times and improving service.
## Technologies Used
* **Simul8:** For constructing and running the simulation models.
* **@Risk:** Employed for fitting data to appropriate distributions to model inter-arrival times and service times.
## Results and Recommendations
The simulation experiments highlighted key areas for potential improvement:
* Reconfiguring the layout of the tables to accommodate more two-person groups reduced wait times significantly.
* Augmenting staff during peak hours led to substantial decreases in food preparation and overall service times.
